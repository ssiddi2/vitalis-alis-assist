# Update Favicon

Copy the uploaded logo image to `public/favicon.png` (replacing the current one) and ensure `index.html` references it correctly.

## Steps

1. Copy `user-uploads://Untitled-4.png` to `public/favicon.png`
2. Verify `index.html` already has `<link rel="icon" href="/favicon.png" type="image/png">` (it does, so no HTML changes needed)

That's it -- one file copy, no code changes required.
